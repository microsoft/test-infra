# Getting Started
## Requirements
### Azure resource requirements
* [An Azure subscription](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cost-management-billing/manage/create-subscription)
* An Azure Service Principal for Jenkins (hence known as the "Jenkins Service Principal") with permissions listed in the "Jenkins Service Principal Permissions"
* [An Azure Key Vault](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-ca/services/key-vault/)
* [An Azure Image Gallery](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/shared-image-galleries) containing images for VM agent deployments (if using VM Agents plugin)

### Jenkins Service Principal Permissions:
* Deployer (you) requires permission to modify the password of the Jenkins Service Principal
* Service Principal needs to have an access policy to allow the "get" and "list" permissions in the specified Key Vault
* Service Principal needs read-only access to Image Gallery specified in configuration/clouds.yml (if using VM Agents plugin)
* After Jenkins is deployed, the Service Principal needs contributor access to the VM Resource Group specified (if using VM Agents plugin) or the resource group set for "AZURE_VM_RESOURCE_GROUP"

### Dependencies
#### Azure CLI
Used to run commands for Azure
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli
```
curl -sL https://aka.ms/InstallAzureCLIDeb | sudo bash
```
#### Kubernetes CLI
Used to run commands for Kubernetes
https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/
```
KUBECTLVERSION=$(curl -s https://storage.googleapis.com/kubernetes-release/release/stable.txt)
curl -LO https://storage.googleapis.com/kubernetes-release/release/${KUBECTLVERSION}/bin/linux/amd64/kubectl
chmod +x ./kubectl
sudo mv ./kubectl /usr/local/bin/kubectl
kubectl version --client
```
#### Helm 3
Used to install Helm Charts for Jenkins ingress
https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/
```
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/helm/helm/master/scripts/get-helm-3 | sudo bash
```

## Installation process
1. Open deploy_jenkins.sh and add in desired configuration. Detailed instructions are written in-script.
2. Create and ensure permissions are granted to the Jenkins Service Principal
3. Add executable permissions by running: `chmod +x deploy_jenkins.sh`
4. If not already done so, log in to Azure by running `az login` and follow the instructions
5. Install Jenkins plugins by running: `./deploy_jenkins.sh` and follow any prompts.
6. When deployment is complete, note down the password and url.
7. Visit the url and log in with the credentials noted down earlier.

# Upgrades and Maintenance

## Updating Jenkin Plugins
* It is recommended to update the plugins through the Jenkins UI
* Alternatively, you can update the plugins list in plugins.txt and run `./deploy_jenkins.sh -p`

## Updating Jenkins Configuration
1. Update `configuration/jenkins.yml` or if you want to keep it separate from core configuration you can add a new YAML file in `configuration/`.
2. Run `./deploy_jenkins.sh -c` to deploy the new configuration to the Jenkins master.
3. Configuration changes can be picked up by restarting Jenkins (during a new Jenkins setup) or by running the 'Master/reload-configuration' job on Jenkins.

_For more information, see https://github.com/jenkinsci/configuration-as-code-plugin_ 

## Updating Jenkins Jobs
1. Update the relevant job in `configuration/jobs/` or add your own job. The jobs shown in this directory uses the [job-dsl-plugin](https://plugins.jenkins.io/job-dsl/) which is usually made up of a combination of YAML, Groovy, Jenkins Pipeline syntax. For examples, see [the demos from Jenkins CasC](https://github.com/jenkinsci/configuration-as-code-plugin/tree/master/demos/jobs).
2. Run `./deploy_jenkins.sh -c` to deploy the new configuration to the Jenkins master.
3. Configuration changes can be picked up by restarting Jenkins (during a new Jenkins setup) or by running the 'Master/reload-configuration' job on Jenkins.

_Job DSL API Reference: https://jenkinsci.github.io/job-dsl-plugin/_

## AKS Cluster Service Principal
The Service Principal used to create the AKS cluster will expire in 1 year. Before that expiry, you will need to update your AKS cluster with new credentials. Refer to this guide for more information: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/update-credentials

## SSL Certificate
The SSL certificates are managed by Jetstack's Cert Manager. Each certificate is valid for 3 months, and will be automatically renewed when within 1 month of expiry.

# Known Issues and Troubleshooting
## Service Principal issues
### Invalid secret for Service Principal
This is usually due to a delay with the Service Principal being propogated out within Azure. Open up deploy_jenkins.sh and manually replace `AKS_SP_ID` and `AKS_SP_SECRET` with corresponding values. For convenience you can find the values in the output of the last run of deploy_jenkins.sh.

## SSL Certificates
### Certificate not issued or valid
You may have a misconfigured resource or you have hit Let's Encrypt's 50 certificate weekly limit.
* Ensure Jenkins ingress has the correct domain with `kubectl describe jenkins-ingress`
* Ensure Cert Manager services are running with `kubectl get pods -n ingress`
* Check for errors with `kubectl describe certificaterequests` and equivalent commands for the `orders` and `challenge` resources.
* Check for errors with https://letsdebug.net/

## Jenkins
### Plugins not initialized or missing
As Jenkins requires a reload after installing plugins, ensure that you are running on a new pod after plugins have been installed. If that is unsuccessful you can reinstall plugins by calling `./deploy_jenkins.sh -p`
